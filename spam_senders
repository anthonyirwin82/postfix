# Manual Blacklist
# Run the command "postmap hash:spam_senders" to build the database
# 
# I block all domains that send me unsolicited emails on a regular basis so I don't have to keep deleting their emails.
# I realise spammers can forge an email address from real domains but as a general rule I would not be dealing with the
# forged domains anyway so blocking them works for me.
#
# I used to block individual email addresses but these days I simply block the entire domain and or subdomain.
#
# I have released my config so other people can use my block list if they wish

# Reject all emails from these domains
