# Manual Whitelist
# Run the command "postmap hash:sender_access" to build the database
#
# These are some of the domains that I have whitelisted as ok to recieve email from. I added the amazonses.com because sometimes
# spammers use amazon ses to send email and the servers get blocked by spam databases and that can block legitimate emails.
#
# I have whitelisted domains that I want to recieve emails from as a kind of paranoia factor to ensure I get the emails.
